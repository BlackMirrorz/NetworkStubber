/**
 A utility enum that processes network stub launch arguments for UI tests.

 This allows network stubs to be passed as a JSON string in launch arguments,
 enabling UI tests to use preconfigured stubbed responses.

 Usage:
 - In UI tests, encode `NetworkStub` objects as JSON and pass them via `XCUIApplication.launchArguments`.
 - On app launch, this processor reads and registers the stubs automatically.

   Processes launch arguments to extract and register network stubs.

   This function checks if the `-NetworkStubs` launch argument exists and contains a valid JSON payload.
   If valid, the stubs are decoded and registered with `NetworkStubber`.
   - Note: This function should be called early in the app lifecycle (e.g., in `AppDelegate` or `SceneDelegate`)
     to ensure stubs are applied before network requests are made.
