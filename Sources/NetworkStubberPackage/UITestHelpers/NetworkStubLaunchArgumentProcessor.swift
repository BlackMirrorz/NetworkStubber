/**
 A utility enum that processes network stub launch arguments for UI tests.

 This allows network stubs to be passed as a Base64-encoded JSON string in launch arguments
 or environment variables, enabling UI tests to use preconfigured stubbed responses.

 ## Usage:
 - In UI tests, encode `NetworkStub` objects as Base64 JSON and pass them via `XCUIApplication.launchArguments`
   or as an environment variable.
 - On app launch, this processor reads the arguments, decodes them, and registers the stubs automatically.

 ## Behavior:
 - If the `-NetworkStubs` environment variable is set, it is prioritized over launch arguments.
 - If the environment variable is absent, it falls back to checking `-NetworkStubs` in launch arguments.
 - Stubs are decoded from Base64 and passed to `NetworkStubber` for use in UI tests.

   Base64-encoded JSON payload. If found, the stubs are decoded and registered with `NetworkStubber`.

   If the environment variable is not set, it falls back to checking the `-NetworkStubs` launch argument.

   - Parameter verboseLogging: Enables detailed logging of the decoding and processing steps.
   - Note: This function should be called early in the app lifecycle (e.g., in `AppDelegate` or `SceneDelegate`)
     to ensure stubs are applied before network requests are made.
